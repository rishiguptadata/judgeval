# Custom Keyword Evaluation with judgeval 🧪⚽

This notebook demonstrates a simple agent evaluation using Judgment Labs' `judgeval` SDK.

## 🔍 What It Does
- Defines a basic custom scorer that checks if the model response includes "Real Madrid"
- Evaluates two outputs using this scorer via `JudgmentClient`
- Visualizes the 50% success rate via the judgeval dashboard

## 📊 Output
See the screenshot `judgeval_result.png` for visual output of the scoring interface.

This was built as part of my exploration for the Judgment Labs AI Engineer challenge to understand how to run a trace and use a custom scorer.
